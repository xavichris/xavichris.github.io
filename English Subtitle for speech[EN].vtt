I decided to read a short poem, I wrote
about the great man I am introducing.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.114
You never gave us up.

3

You never let us down.

4
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.100
You never ran around and deserted us.

5
00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:24.843
You never made us cry.

6
00:00:25.043 --> 00:00:26.557
You never said goodbye.

7
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.729
You never told a lie to hurt us

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.800
and we are never going to give you up.
